<h1>Lesson 1: Introduction to PHP</h1>

<h2>What is PHP?</h2>
<p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language that is commonly used to create dynamic web pages. It is powerful, easy to learn, and widely used on the web. PHP scripts are executed on the server and the resulting HTML is sent to the client's web browser.</p>

<h2>Why is PHP used?</h2>
<p>PHP is used for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creating dynamic web pages</li>
    <li>Processing form data</li>
    <li>Storing and retrieving data from a database</li>
    <li>Generating reports and charts</li>
    <li>Sending emails and performing other server-side tasks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting up a PHP development environment</h2>
<p>To start writing PHP scripts, you will need to install PHP on your computer. You can download the latest version of PHP from the official website (https://www.php.net/downloads.php). You will also need a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write and edit your code. There are many options available, such as Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, or PHPStorm.</p>

<p>To test your PHP scripts in a web browser, you can use a development server. One option is to use the built-in PHP development server, which you can start by running the following command from the command line:</p>
<pre>php -S localhost:8000</pre>
<p>This will start a development server on your local machine and allow you to access your PHP scripts through a web browser at the URL <code>http://localhost:8000</code>.</p>
