This directory contains the materials for Lesson 1 of the PHP Fundamentals for Beginners course.

## Lesson Description

In this lesson, you will learn about:

- Setting up a PHP development environment

## Materials

- `index.php`: a PHP script with code examples and explanations for the concepts covered in this lesson

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required for this lesson.

## Installation

To set up a local development environment for this lesson, you will need to install PHP on your computer. You can download the latest version of PHP from the official website (https://www.php.net/downloads.php). You will also need a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write and edit your code.

To test the script in a web browser, navigate to the directory containing `index.php` and run the following command:

```php -S localhost:8000```

This will start a development server on your local machine and allow you to access the script through a web browser at the URL `http://localhost:8000`.
