# Lesson 3: Control Structures

In this lesson, you will learn about control structures in PHP. Specifically, you will learn about:

- `if` statements for making decisions based on conditions
- `switch` statements for making decisions based on multiple cases
- `while` loops for repeating a block of code until a condition is met
- `do-while` loops for repeating a block of code at least once and then continuing until a condition is met
- `for` loops for repeating a block of code a specific number of times

You will also learn how to use the `break` and `continue` statements to control the flow of your loops and decisions.

## Example Code

To help you get started, this lesson includes an example PHP file with comments explaining each control structure and its usage. Simply run the file using the PHP CLI to see the output.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
