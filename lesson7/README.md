# Lesson 7: Working with Files

In this lesson, you will learn about working with files in PHP. Specifically, you will learn about:

- Reading and writing to files using `file_get_contents` and `file_put_contents`
- Reading and writing to files line by line using `fopen`, `fgets`, `fwrite`, and `fclose`
- Checking if a file exists using `file_exists`
- Deleting a file using `unlink`

## Example Code

To help you get started, this lesson includes an example PHP file with comments explaining each aspect of working with files and their usage. Simply run the file using the PHP CLI to see the output.
