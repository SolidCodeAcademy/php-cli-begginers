# Lesson 8: Including Files

In this lesson, you will learn about including files in PHP. Specifically, you will learn about:

- Using `include` and `require` to include a file in your PHP code
- Using `include_once` and `require_once` to include a file only once, even if it is included multiple times

## Example Code

To help you get started, this lesson includes an example PHP file with comments explaining each aspect of including files and their usage. Simply run the file using the PHP CLI to see the output.

This example assumes that you have a separate file called "functions.php" with a simple function defined inside it.
